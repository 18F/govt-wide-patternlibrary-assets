# USWDS for designers

This repository hosts editable, open source design files of the [United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for government designers or anyone wishing to make use of the USWDS UI components or visual styles.

With the release of USWDS 2.0, we've made some major changes to the way our assets are structured. **For now, these assets are only available as Sketch files for the Macintosh.** These files have been tested with Sketch 53. We'll be working to provide assets for other formats as soon as possible.

### Updating the USWDS documentation site

These archive files generated by `npm run release` may then be manually copied over to the [files directory](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-site/tree/master/files) of the USWDS Site for distribution on the [For Designers - Getting Started](https://designsystem.digital.gov/getting-started/designers/) page.
