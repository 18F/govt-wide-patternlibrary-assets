# U.S. Web Design Standards Assets

This is the repo for the Government Wide Pattern Library asset files. The purpose
of this repository is to create open source design files based on the components
created in the main Government Wide Pattern Library project [https://github.com/18F/govt-wide-patternlibrary](https://github.com/18F/govt-wide-patternlibrary).

For the initial alpha release, included are font files and an editable .ai and .eps file, as well as a .png for each of pattern on the site. In future releases, we will work to include .psd and Sketch files to support broader software usage. 

We encourage and solicit your feedback. Please leave any comments in the project's primary repo: https://github.com/18F/govt-wide-patternlibrary/issues
